  <h1>Homemade Boiled Water</h1>
  <h2>A staple in every home</h2>

  <p>
    From Wikipedia:
  </p>
  <p>
    Boiling is the rapid vaporization of a liquid, which occurs when a liquid is
    heated to its boiling point, the temperature at which the vapour pressure of
    the liquid is equal to the pressure exerted on the liquid by the surrounding
    atmosphere. There are two main types of boiling: nucleate boiling where small
    bubbles of vapour form at discrete points, and critical heat flux boiling
    where the boiling surface is heated above a certain critical temperature and
    a film of vapor forms on the surface. Transition boiling is an intermediate,
    unstable form of boiling with elements of both types. The boiling point of
    water is 100 째C or 212 째F but is lower with the decreased atmospheric pressure
    found at higher altitudes.

  <p>
    Boiling water is used as a method of making it potable by killing microbes
    that may be present. The sensitivity of different micro-organisms to heat
    varies, but if water is held at 70 째C (158 째F) for ten minutes, many organisms
    are killed, but some are more resistant to heat and require one minute at the
    boiling point of water.
